# my very first website

Welcome!
[Code Institute](https://codeinstitute.net)
 This website was created with the aid of code institute to teach me about Github and the language, syntax and context that we use when using not only the git hub terminal but also commands in Git
 This was created using CSS and HTML and is hosted on GITHUB pages,
